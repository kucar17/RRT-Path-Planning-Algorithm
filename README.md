This script is designed for the demonstration of a Sampling Based RRT Path Planning which creates a path for a robot in an environment which consists of obstacles. The scripts takes a obstacles.csv file as its input and then finds a path with guides a robot from a starting point to an end point. The path is then simulated on CoppeliaSim robot simulation software.

One of the solutions the Path Planning Problem:

* The project is conducted as the Peer Graded Assignment of the "Modern Robotics, Course 4: Robot Motion Planning and Control by Northwestern University" on Coursera.
